# Nginx + MariaDB/MySQL + PHP-FPM + PHP 7.0 + phpMyAdmin + Redis

Based on [laradock](https://github.com/LaraDock/laradock) (an environment to
start with Laravel).

It's made for having a __PHP__ + __DB__ environment quickly through
docker-compose configuration. You can use any library or framework.

The _workspace_ container gives you a basic Bash + PHP (with Composer) installation.
